#  Artist's Website - Project 1

Website presents artwork of North Carolina's local artist Chris McCullen. Visitors will find examples of his artwork including drawings, paintings and metal work as well as will be able to learn more about the artist himself and if they wish they contact him directly via contact form. More artwork including music pieces will be added at later stage of website development.

This project is for education and training purposes and can not be used as a template for business use. The goal for this project is to build a responsive website using HTML and CSS with minimal toutches of JavaScript. FlexBox and CSS Grid were used to make website responsive. Photo and artwork copywrites belong to Chris McCullen, the artist.
