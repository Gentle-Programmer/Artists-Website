        <p>When asked who I am I always like to have, at least, a moderately specific answer. But not one
            so specific that I can’t change direction when presented with new information. Therefore, my
            name is Chris McCullen. I was born a while ago and here I am today. I hope that you are doing
            well. I have been a child, a student, a mentor and a ghost. My industry is as a Firefighter and I
            have been at that business for twenty years. I have seen things as a firefighter that I hope you
            never get to see, at least in person. I occasionally use art and music as a therapy to hush the
            voices and turn down the dreams. I can’t remember ever not doing so even as a child. I did not
            grow up hard but I lost many loved ones in a compressed time period and it probably scarred
            me when I wasn’t looking. I was eleven years old when my father died by suicide and several
            illnesses and accidents took many of the people that I looked up to and loved so that by the time
            I was twenty I had two adult male relatives left to look up to. Both had their own families so I just
            sort of made it up as I went along. Now in my late forties I lift weights, write songs and make
            something out of nothing with art. I also read books and write notions down here and there. I
            even wrote a book and will most likely get around to publishing it soon. Here are some of my
            drawings and songs. I hope you like them. Thanks.</p>
